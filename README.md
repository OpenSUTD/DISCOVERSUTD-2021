# DiscoverSUTD 2021

## What?
DiscoverSUTD is a 3 week long introduction to the SUTD community.

DiscoverSUTD was started by the team behind [OpenSUTD](https://opensutd.org/).

OpenSUTD is modelled after the idea of an Open Organisation, and we have community standards for all members to abide by in order to ensure a good environment for members to learn and contribute effectively.

An Open Organization is one that engages participative communities both inside and out; responds to opportunities more quickly, has access to resources and talent outside the organization, and inspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act.
