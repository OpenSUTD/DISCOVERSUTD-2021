            Also we hope that having the cohort gather regularly might help in building a stronger community through encouraging people to share about their day, hopes and experiences at SUTD. 
            
            Since youâ€™ll be having Supper with Seniors, do look forward to learn something new from them!

                        My specialisation is in Computer Networks & Cloud Computing. I have been very involved in fifth rows such as NihonGo (the Japanese Cultural Club) and 3DC (Digital Design and Development) and helping out in SUTD events such as Virtual Open House.
                        
                        I strongly believe that SUTD is a place where you learn best by doing crazy things, not mugging. If you are like me and have a tendency to do wild, come talk to me and I can share about my craziest experiences in SUTD!</p>

                          Holla! I'm Alex, a MNEED Dual Masters student. I've just returned from a 9 month IC Design course in Taiwan's Chang Gung University, and I'm now lurking the labs doing drone battery things. Before that, I was a scrub in the EPD Robotics Track with too many Fifth Rows for his own good.
                          
                          Stuff that tickles my pickles: 
                          - Presenting, public speaking, emceeing. And also a little writing.
                          - DnD (did you know we have an SUTDnD group?)
                          - Food. I love food and am filled with a chonky spirit.
                          - Complaining about SUTD like the boomer I am.
                          - History, politics, and geography.
                          - Whiskey. Especially of the Islay variety.

                        Holla! I'm Alex, a MNEED Dual Masters student. I've just returned from a 9 month IC Design course in Taiwan's Chang Gung University, and I'm now lurking the labs doing drone battery things. Before that, I was a scrub in the EPD Robotics Track with too many Fifth Rows for his own good.
                        
                        Stuff that tickles my pickles: 
                        - Presenting, public speaking, emceeing. And also a little writing.
                        - DnD (did you know we have an SUTDnD group?)
                        - Food. I love food and am filled with a chonky spirit.
                        - Complaining about SUTD like the boomer I am.
                        - History, politics, and geography.
                        - Whiskey. Especially of the Islay variety.
