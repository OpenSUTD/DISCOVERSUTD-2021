Starting from coordinating the graduate program core architecture studio sequence in Washington University in St Louis, USA; to incorporating digital design to core architecture studios in the American University of Sharjah, UAE. In SUTD, she had the pleasure to craft the foundation design curricula that premises on interdisciplinary design. Outside teaching, she direct Dynamic Assemblies Lab, a research lab in SUTD that explores design applications in biomaterial fabrication, Computational Fluid Dynamic simulation, and interactive architectural surfaces. She is also a partner at Yogiaman Tracy Design a design practice that focus on the utilization of digital techniques along with contextual influences to create culturally embedded, affective work.

                        Norman currently teaches programming at SUTD, teaching mainly first-year programming courses in Python and Java.

Prior to joining SUTD, he spent the past nine years teaching in the local polytechnic sector. In that time, he taught mainly mathematics and physics but also had opportunities to teach C++ programming, introductory data mining, and mechanics of materials. 

His current research interest is in learning analytics, especially in investigating the insights that can be gained by applying data-mining techniques to student data. He is also interested in the various issues related to teaching and learning in higher education, including but not limited to assessment practices and learning design.

When he is not at work, he enjoys classical music, sings with a choir, and loves traveling.

                              He is a ISTD PhD student starting this Sept where he had just graduated from ISTD recently! His specialisation is in Computer Networks & Cloud Computing. He has been very involved in fifth rows such as NihonGo (the Japanese Cultural Club) and 3DC (Digital Design and Development) and helping out in SUTD events such as Virtual Open House.

He strongly believes that SUTD is a place where you learn best by doing crazy things, not mugging. If you are like him and have a tendency to do wild, come talk to him where he can share his craziest experiences in SUTD!

                    He was in the EPD pillar, studying the mechanical engineering track. His capstone project was on a robot that draws on a very large wall (3x5 meter) ! It was designed from scratch with his team and manufactured almost from scratch with heavy use of 3D printed components! If you are interested in programming, game development or Unity as well, keep reading! 

He has had opportunities playing around with Unity 3D Engine in the C# language, working on a Virtual Reality (VR) digital recreation of SWaT, the water treatment facility at iTrust Centre (SUTD) for part-time work. It displays live data from the water facility and shows critical indicators in the physical representation in the game, real time. He also did a couple of other Unity projects for 3.007 (Design), 30.007 (Engineering Design Innovation) to recreate a playable robot animation in Unity, and also some others including internship with SUTD Game Lab using Unity. 

He has also been involved in SUTD Christian Fellowship and SUTD Drama, performing as a main actor for a 2019 performance of All My Sons (Arthur Miller)
